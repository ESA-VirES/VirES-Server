      <li><b>Dynamic range calculation for models</b><br>When changing model parameters (for SIFM, IGRF12, CHAOS-5 and Custom Model), such as the coefficient range or height, the colorscale range is calculated and adjusted automatically. It is still possible to manually adjust the range with both textfields available in the settings panel. This change was introduced as it became clear that finding the correct range after changing model parameters was cumbersome for users and we wanted to facilitate the process.</li>
      <li><b>Single axis interaction</b><br>When exploring the scatterplot, one can scroll when hovering over an axis to zoom along one axis while keeping the other axes ranges fixed. Similarily one can drag on an axis to pan the plot. These features apply to both the x-axis and the y-axes and complement the zooming and panning one can perform on the scatterplot itself to zoom along all axes.</li>
      <li><b>Zoom limit removed</b><br>The zoom limit previously applied to the scatterplot is now removed. There are now no restrictions to how far you can zoom in or out. A reset button is added to enable the user to return to the initial zoom level and position at one's convenience.</li>
      <li><b>Customizable filter list</b><br>The data filter histograms found in the Analytics View can be removed individually, and new histograms for any other available parameter can be added by selecting it in the histogram "Add" dropdown menu. Any active filters will be removed when its corresponding histogram is removed. In addition the filters can be hidden to allow for more space for the scatterplot.</li>
      <li><b>Secondary y-axis</b><br>When selecting multiple parameters a second y-axis will appear. When selecting two parameters this means that each parameter has its own axis. If more than two parameters are selected, they will be grouped according to their range, such that the parameters with the most similar value ranges are grouped together and share an axis.</li>
      <li><b>Scatterplot units</b><br>The units are now displayed in a parenthesis next to the axis parameter labels in the scatterplot.</li>
      <li><b>Extended time selection</b><br>The time selection limit when selecting a time window from the time slider has been extended from 15 days to 30 days. The limit when downloading products has not changed and is still set at the equivalent of 5 unfiltered MAGX_LR products.</li>
